# Code for Reduced Minimal Models and Torsion
This repository contains the code that verifies the main result of the paper *Reduced Minimal Model and Torsion* by Alexander Barrios.


This code was written on SageMath, and the repository consists of  files:

(1) definitions.sage

(2) Section3.ipynb

(3) Section4.ipynb

(4) detailedC2C2.ipynb

(5) Cremonadatabase.ipynb

File (1) contains the definitions that are called by (2),(3), and (4).

File (2) verifies statements made in Section 3.

File (3) verifies the call cases in Theorem 4.1.

File (4) verifies the the proof of Theorem 4.1 in the case of T=C_2 \times C_2.

File (5) verifies the numbers provided in Table 4.
